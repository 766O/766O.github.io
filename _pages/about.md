I am an M.S./Ph.D. Integrated student at the Hanyang University Multimodal AI Lab,
under the supervision of Professor Dong-Jin Kim.

My research focuses on Multimodal AI, specifically Multimodal learning.
   
1. **Data Issues in Deep Learning**: I am interested in effective learning strategies for multimodal tasks under data-constrained conditions.

2. **Utilizing Synthetic Data**: I am interested in effective methods for utilizing synthetic data.
