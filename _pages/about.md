I am an undergraduate intern student at the Hanyang University Multimodal AI Lab,
under the supervision of Professor Dong-jin Kim.

My research focuses on Multimodal AI, specifically Multimodal learning.

1. **Data efficient Domain adaptation & generalization**: Perform domain adaptation and generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings using a multimodal embedding space.
   
2. **Data Issues in Deep Learning**: An effective approach to addressing long-tail scenarios and data scarcity in the vision domain by leveraging text information.

3. **Utilizing synthetic data**: Efficient methods for utilizing synthetic data.
